# Lab 10 - Hash Tables
## Objectives and Concepts:
   The objective of this lab was to learn how to implement a hash table using linear probing.
   
## Contributions:
    The whole lab was completed as a group coding collaboration using Nathan Sucher's account during and after class time.

### Inferences
    The insertion/add function for the Hash Table had a time complexity of O(1), with a few outliers but overall an O(1) time complexity which is what is expected.

### Inferences
    The get/retrieve function for the Hash Table had a time complexity of O(1), with two outlying values but overall an O(1) time complexity which is what is expected.
