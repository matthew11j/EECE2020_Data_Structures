# Lab 7 - AVL Trees
## Objectives and Concepts:
   The objective of this lab was to learn how to implement a self-balancing binary search tree called an AVL, create a menu for inserting and removing items,
   and also a display function that displays the tree.
   
## Contributions:
    Matthew Jackson: Created README file, created displayHelp function.
    Nathan Sucher: Added header files and binary search tree files from last lab.
    Sara VanDewerker: Created getHeight function.
    
    All other functions were created as a collaboration between all three partners.
    
    Most of the time spent working on this lab was during and after class on a single computer, with all three of the partners working
    on it together.

## Self-Balancing Cases
### Case 1 (bf(x) = -2 & bf(y) = -1): 
    Inputs: 10, 11, 12.

### Case 2 (bf(x) = 2 & bf(y) = 1): 
    Inputs: 4, 3, 1.
