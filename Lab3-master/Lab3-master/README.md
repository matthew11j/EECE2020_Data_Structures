# Lab 3 - Pointer based Stacks and Queues
## Objectives and Concepts:
   The objective of this lab was to create the a maze game that is solved automatically. The
   main objective of the game was to learn how to implement stacks and queues using nodes and 
   pointers. Other concepts explored, were implementing header files and cpp files and adding
   them into the main cpp file to help keep the code clean looking. In addition to this we learned 
   to use virutal fucntions and derived classes in our header files. We also learned to use templates
   to allow us to write functions that can work with any data type. 
   
## Contributions:
    Matthew Jackson:  Added Display function, exception header file, Maze Fill Function, and start of game function.
    Nathan Sucher:    Created Queue header, queueTest file, and stackTest file.
    Sara VanDewerker: Created Stack, Node, and coordinates header files and also created backtracking function.
    
    All other functions were created as a collaboration between all three partners.
