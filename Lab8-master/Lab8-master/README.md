# Lab 8 - Heaps & Priority Queues
## Objectives and Concepts:
   The objective of this lab was to learn how to implement a Heap and a Priority Queue and to evaluate the insert and remove execution times
   for both the Heap and Priority Queue.
   
## Contributions:
    The whole lab was completed as a group coding collaboration using Matthew Jackson's account during and after class time.
